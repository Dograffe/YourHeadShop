# YourHeadShop

# Basic Info

This plugin is an Addon for ChestShop.

When Purchasing from a Shop with itemID "Player Head" the player will be given their own head.

Whilst non-ops are able to create these shops they are effectively useless as the unnamed "Player Head" 
item is unobtainable in survival minecraft and thus the shop is unable to be stocked.

Hence, This plugin is primarily designed for use in Admin Shops as a way for players to obtain their Own Head.

Note: players can still sell any head by using the item id given to them by /iteminfo
